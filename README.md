Code and documents for the internship

## Day 2

9:50 am -

Learned how to use grid layouts.

MAde first hello world pyqt5 program, practicing now making a UI and having it interact with code.

## Day 1
12:00pm-4:00pm


Set up pyQT5 on my computer and began learning pyQT5. Its a tool that lets you use QT5 with python (since QT5 is C++ based). QT5 is used to make GUI's. pyqt5 may be phased out soon in favor of a n official qt5 for python tool but they are very similar and pyqt5 is commonly used now. pyqt5 is used in napari so it still needs to be learned either way. 

qt designer may be useful in editing pyqt applications

to set up python and pyqt 5:
install python
make sure pip works
run: pip install PyQt5 (you may need python -m or py -m before the pip)

pyqt programs are built on 2 objects Q application and main window. The first handles events and initalization of modules aand is largely automatic. The main window does graphics and logic and is where most work is done.

the main window has graphical elements called widgets and has a bunch of built in widgets that are very similar to how html, css, and js widgets sort of work. Qwidget is an empty container used for formatting (like a flexbox I think) and other Qwidgetname widgets do toher things liek render buttons or text fields.

Learned how to make simple program with basic widgets, though non-functional
