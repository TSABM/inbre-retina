Accepted formats are the image/video formats currently accepted by the application. Each one extends the abstract format.
The goal is to make it easy to set a pattern for rendering new image and video types. If the abstracts pattern is followed
then essentially any (one dimensional for now) image or video that can return pixmaps ought to be renderable.
standard image will probably render jpegs and pngs. Simple movie probably will handle gifs and a couple others.
